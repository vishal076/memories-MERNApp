## Introduction


Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB we'll build a Full Stack MERN Application . The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

We'll deploy this project on Heroku(backend) and Netlify(frontend) both.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app.
